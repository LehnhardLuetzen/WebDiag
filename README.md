diagram Webapp with mysql, laravel, backbone and raphael

This simple Webapplication i create to evaluate the laravel framework as restfull application with the possibility to create diffrent types of diagrams, which can be created, shared and used by diffrent persons at the same time.

To get a better abstaction in the code i use backbone.js
For drawing Lines between the diffrent shapes (which are standard html div containers) i use the raphael.js libary.
For dragging the shapes i use the jquery and jqueryUI frameworks.

Many stuff for me which is quite new for me. so everyone which is interested is inveted to checkout the source and give me hints, how they would make things better then me.
